# Key features

1. **Lifecycle definition authoring** (DSL): states, transitions, guards, actions (sync/async), approval steps, notifications, retry policy, compensation actions.
2. **Versioning of lifecycle definitions** and migration tools for instances.
3. **Lifecycle instances**: attach to any domain object (by type + id), track current state, metadata, properties.
4. **Graphical state visualizer** and authoring UI with validation and simulation.
5. **Approval workflows**: roles-based approvers, parallel/serial approvals, deadline handling, escalations.
6. **Scheduling**: time-based transitions (e.g., publish at), TTL state transitions (e.g., auto-deprecate after 1 year).
7. **Eventing & Outbox**: publish lifecycle.events.{entityType} via Kafka; transactional outbox for guaranteed delivery.
8. **Webhooks & callbacks** for systems that need push notifications.
9. **Adapters & SDKs**: lightweight client libraries for Java/JS, and generic webhook/gRPC adapters.
10. **Audit & history**: complete immutable timeline with who/what/when/why.
11. **Simulation & dry-run**: test transitions without changing live instances.
12. **Access control**: RBAC and approval scoping per tenant.
13. **Multi-tenant support**: tenant-specific definitions and overrides.
14. **Data retention & archiving** rules and GDPR-friendly deletion/erase.
15. **Admin operations**: force transition, rollback, snapshot restore, bulk operations.
16. **Observability**: metrics, traces, dashboards, alerting, and audit exports.

# Domain model (conceptual)

* **LifecycleDefinition** (id, key, name, version, json/yaml, createdBy, createdAt, tenantId)
* **LifecycleTransition** (id, definitionId, fromState, toState, name, guardExpression, actions\[])
* **LifecycleInstance** (id, entityType, entityId, definitionId, definitionVersion, currentState, metadata jsonb, createdAt, updatedAt, tenantId)
* **LifecycleEvent** (id, instanceId, eventType, payload jsonb, status, createdAt)
* **Approval** (id, instanceId, transitionId, approverId, status, comments, createdAt, resolvedAt)
* **Schedule** (id, instanceId, transitionId, executeAt, cronExpression?, status)
* **AuditRecord** (id, instanceId, actor, action, details jsonb, timestamp)

> Data fields: use UUIDs for IDs, JSONB for flexible metadata, timestamps with timezone.

# Example lifecycle for product publishing (illustrative)

States: `Draft` -> `Review` -> `Approved` -> `Published` -> `Deprecated` -> `Deleted`

Transitions examples:

* `submit_for_review` (Draft -> Review) — triggers notification.
* `approve` (Review -> Approved) — requires 1-2 approvers (parallel/serial configurable).
* `publish` (Approved -> Published) — scheduled publish support (executeAt).
* `deprecate` (Published -> Deprecated) — TTL based or manual.
* `delete` (Deprecated -> Deleted) — hard-delete after retention.

Guards/actions: validate metadata completeness, call product-indexer service to index on `Published`, publish Kafka event `lifecycle.event.product.published`.

---

# APIs (REST first, add gRPC later)

All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` and `X-Tenant-Id` header for multi-tenant.

### Lifecycle definitions

* `GET /api/v1/lifecycles` — list definitions (filters: tenant, entityType)
* `POST /api/v1/lifecycles` — create lifecycle definition (YAML/JSON body)
* `GET /api/v1/lifecycles/{key}/versions` — list versions
* `GET /api/v1/lifecycles/{key}/versions/{version}` — get definition
* `PUT /api/v1/lifecycles/{key}/versions/{version}` — update (create new version)
* `POST /api/v1/lifecycles/{key}/simulate` — simulate transitions given instance state

### Lifecycle instances

* `POST /api/v1/instances` — create instance `{ entityType, entityId, lifecycleKey, lifecycleVersion?, metadata? }`
* `GET /api/v1/instances/{id}` — get instance and current state
* `POST /api/v1/instances/{id}/transitions` — request a transition `{ transitionName, actor, reason, payload, idempotencyKey? }`
* `GET /api/v1/instances/{id}/history` — audit timeline
* `POST /api/v1/instances/{id}/schedule` — schedule transition `{ transitionName, executeAt/crontab }`
* `POST /api/v1/instances/{id}/force` — admin forced transition (audit recorded)

### Approvals

* `GET /api/v1/approvals?assignee=...` — list pending approvals
* `POST /api/v1/approvals/{id}/resolve` — `{ decision: APPROVE|REJECT, comments }`

### Admin

* `POST /api/v1/definitions/{key}/migrate` — bulk migrate instances to new version
* `POST /api/v1/instances/bulk` — bulk create or bulk transition
* `GET /api/v1/metrics/health` — LMS health and metrics summary

---

# Events & messaging

* Publish event types: `lifecycle.instance.created`, `lifecycle.transition.requested`, `lifecycle.transition.executed`, `lifecycle.approval.requested`, `lifecycle.approval.resolved`, `lifecycle.instance.archived`.
* Use Kafka topics: `lifecycle.events` with a `type` and `entityType` header for routing. Schema: Avro/Protobuf for strong typing.
* Implement transactional outbox pattern: write event to `outbox` table in same DB tx as instance update; separate outbox worker publishes to Kafka.
* Provide webhook subscription service: `POST /api/v1/subscriptions` to register domain services to receive HTTP callbacks for particular event types.

---

# Integration patterns

* **Push**: domain services subscribe to `lifecycle.events` or register webhooks.
* **Pull**: domain services query `GET /api/v1/instances?entityType=Product&entityId=...` to reconcile state.
* **Callback adapters**: provide small adapters or libraries to handle idempotency, retries and verify events.
* **Saga coordination**: LMS emits events; downstream services may run compensating actions if downstream failure occurs (LMS supports compensation actions as part of transition definition).

---

# State machine engine — design options

**Option A — Declarative engine (recommended)**

* Store definitions as JSON/YAML. Interpret them at runtime with an in-memory engine that enforces guards/actions.
* Persist instance state and transition history.
* Use a small rule engine for guard expressions (e.g., MVEL, SpEL) but sandboxed — prefer compiled expressions with limited capabilities.

**Option B — External workflow engine**

* Use Temporal/Zeebe for complex long-running workflows and retries. The LMS acts as a thin control plane and stores definitions in Temporal. Good when heavy orchestration required.

Note: start with Option A for simplicity, design abstraction so later you can plug in Temporal for complex orchestrations.

# Persistence & schema (Postgres recommended)

Tables (summary):

* `lifecycle_definitions` (uuid, key, version int, name, payload jsonb, tenant\_id, created\_by, created\_at)
* `lifecycle_instances` (uuid, entity\_type, entity\_id, definition\_key, definition\_version, current\_state, metadata jsonb, created\_at, updated\_at)
* `lifecycle_events_outbox` (uuid, topic, payload jsonb, status, retry\_count, created\_at, last\_attempt\_at)
* `lifecycle_approvals` (uuid, instance\_id, transition\_name, approver, status, comments, created\_at, resolved\_at)
* `lifecycle_history` (uuid, instance\_id, actor, action, details jsonb, timestamp)
* `lifecycle_schedules` (uuid, instance\_id, transition\_name, execute\_at, cron\_expr, status)

Indexes: primary by uuid, unique(entity\_type, entity\_id) if one instance per entity, index on (tenant\_id), index on scheduled time for job polling.

Retention: archive history older than X days to a cold store (S3) if required.

---

# Concurrency, idempotency & resilience

* Require `idempotency-key` header for transition requests and scheduled jobs to ensure exactly-once semantics.
* Use optimistic locking on `lifecycle_instances` (version column) to avoid lost updates.
* Durable scheduling: store schedules in DB and have worker pool claim jobs (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED).
* Dead-letter queue for failed events with admin UI to reprocess.
* Retries: exponential backoff for external actions, configurable per-action in definition.

---

# Security and access control

* Authentication: OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (JWT tokens).
* Authorization: RBAC with roles: `LIFECYCLE_ADMIN`, `LIFECYCLE_DEVELOPER`, `APPROVER`, `AUDITOR`.
* Fine-grained permissions on lifecycle definitions and instances (tenant-scoped).
* Approval policies: require approver to present credentials; actions recorded with actor identity.
* Secrets: avoid storing credentials in lifecycle definition—use references to secrets manager.

---

# UI / UX

* **Authoring UI**: visual graph editor, JSON/YAML toggle, validation errors, version publish button.
* **Instance dashboard**: list instances by entityType, filter by state, tenant, date; detail panel with state timeline and action buttons.
* **Approval inbox**: approvers see pending approvals, SLA timers, accept/reject with comments.
* **Admin tools**: migration runner, outbox monitor, dead-letter reprocessor, audit export.

---

# Observability & operations

* Tracing: OpenTelemetry for distributed traces (tag events with instanceId).
* Metrics: Prometheus metrics for counts of transitions, failed transitions, approvals pending, schedule backlog.
* Logs: structured logging (JSON), correlate with requestId and instanceId.
* Dashboards: Grafana dashboards for key metrics and SLA breaches.
* Alerts: alert on failed publish rate, approval SLA misses, outbox publish lag.

---

# Testing strategy

* Unit tests for engine, guard evaluation and action dispatch.
* Integration tests with embedded Postgres + test Kafka (or Testcontainers) for outbox.
* Contract tests (PACT) for event consumers/producers.
* End-to-end tests for full lifecycle including approvals and scheduled transitions.
* Property-based tests for state machine invariants.

---

# Deployment & infra

* Package as Spring Boot 3 native-friendly JAR; consider Graal native-image later.
* Deploy on Kubernetes with Helm charts. Use HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) and adequate resource requests/limits.
* DB: managed Postgres (RDS/Azure/GCP Cloud SQL) with read replicas if needed.
* Messaging: Kafka cluster (or managed Kafka) with topics partitioned by tenant or entity type for scale.
* CI/CD: build pipelines that validate lifecycle definitions (lint), run integration tests, and deploy via GitOps.

# Roadmap / Implementation phases

1. **MVP (4-8 weeks)**

   * Core lifecycle definitions CRUD, instances CRUD, simple in-memory engine with persistent instance state
   * REST APIs, outbox with Kafka producer, simple authoring UI (JSON editor)
   * Basic RBAC and auditing

2. **Phase 2 (8-12 weeks)**

   * Approval workflows, scheduling engine, graphical authoring UI
   * Webhooks, subscription management, transactional outbox
   * Observability (OTel + Prometheus)

3. **Phase 3 (ongoing)**

   * Temporal/Zeebe integration for heavy orchestrations
   * Multi-tenant optimizations, performance tuning
   * SDKs, richer UI, policy engine, full lifecycle migration tools

---

# Operational considerations & gotchas

* Carefully design guard expression execution to avoid unsafe code execution (use a sandboxed expression evaluator).
* Balance feature richness with performance: large numbers of scheduled transitions require a job-scheduler optimized with partitioning.
* Ensure event schemas are versioned and backwards compatible.
* Provide admin tools for replay/reconciliation when system drift occurs.
