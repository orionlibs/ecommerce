# Inventory Metrics & Telemetry Aggregator Service — REST API surface

Nice — here’s a comprehensive, focused RESTful API design for an **Inventory Metrics & Telemetry Aggregator** service. This service ingests telemetry and metrics from Inventory/WMS/3PL/warehouse devices and exposes queryable aggregates, rollups, anomaly detection, alerts, dashboards, exports and health/usage APIs. I include *only* endpoints relevant to telemetry/metrics aggregation, storage, querying, alerting, and admin for this service (no product, order, cart, pricing, or other business-domain APIs).

Base conventions (applies across endpoints)

* Base path: `https://api.example.com/v1/telemetry` (or `/v1/metrics`)
* Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (OAuth2/JWT) or API keys for services. Multi-tenant via `X-Tenant-ID` header or tenant-scoped paths `/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/telemetry`.
* Content type: `application/json`. For raw metric ingestion support `application/x-ndjson`, `application/octet-stream` (Prometheus remote\_write), or `application/vnd.kafka.binary` when relevant.
* Time format: RFC3339 / ISO8601 with timezone.
* Pagination: `page/limit` or cursor.
* Common query params: `start`, `end`, `granularity` (e.g., `60s`, `1m`, `5m`, `1h`), `group_by`, `filters`, `metric`, `aggregation` (sum, avg, min, max, p50,p90), `timezone`.
* Responses: `200`, `201`, `202` (async), `204`, `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `422`, `500`.

# Design considerations & best practices (brief)

* **Metric schema discipline:** enforce and version metric schema to avoid high-cardinality explosions; provide warnings on cardinality.
* **Hybrid ingest model:** accept push (API/prometheus/OTLP) and pull (connectors) with strong idempotency and backpressure handling.
* **Tiered storage + rollups:** hot (raw, short retention) + warm (rollups) + cold (archived) to bound storage costs while supporting queries.
* **Downsampling & pre-aggregations:** proactively create rollups for common groupings (per-sku per-location hourly/daily) to make queries fast.
* **Anomaly & forecast workflows:** include baseline forecasting models for expected depletion and anomaly detection to reduce false positives.
* **Low-latency alerting:** separate fast path for alert evaluation (streaming) and heavier ML jobs (batch).
* **Backfill & reconciliation:** robust backfill jobs to recover from outages and UIs to inspect ingest gaps.
* **Observability & SLOs:** expose ingest latency, queue depth, dropped events; enforce SLOs and per-tenant quotas.
* **Cost controls:** expose usage and cost estimates for retention and query load; allow tenants to set auto-archive policies.
* **Security & privacy:** redact/avoid PII in telemetry; audit schema/retention changes.
* **APIs for operations:** provide admin endpoints for compaction, export before deletion, and forced re-computation of rollups.

If you’d like I can next:

* generate an **OpenAPI skeleton** for the core ingestion + query + alerts endpoints,
* design the **time-series storage schema** and rollup tables (example DDL for ClickHouse/TimescaleDB),
* or produce a **sample client SDK** (Node/Python) that demonstrates safe ingestion (idempotency, batching, retry/backoff).

Which of those should I produce now?
