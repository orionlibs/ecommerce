# Order Analytics & Reporting Service — REST API surface

Nice — below is a comprehensive, focused REST API design for an **Order Analytics & Reporting Service**. This service ingests order/fulfillment/payment events (or reads them from event streams), computes rollups, KPIs, cohorts, funnels and advanced analytics, and provides queryable APIs, dashboards, scheduled reports, anomaly detection and exports for BI/ops. **Only** endpoints relevant to analytics/reporting are included (no order CRUD, fulfillment, billing, etc.).

## Conventions (applies to all endpoints)

* Base path: `https://api.example.com/v1/order-analytics`
* Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (OAuth2/JWT). Tenant-scoped via `X-Tenant-ID` header or tenant path `/v1/{tenantId}/order-analytics`.
* Content-Type: `application/json`. Bulk ingestion accepts NDJSON or S3 pointer.
* Time format: RFC3339 / ISO8601 with timezone. Use `start` and `end` params when appropriate.
* Pagination: cursor-style `cursor` + `limit` (or `page`/`limit` for convenience).
* Granularity: `granularity` values like `1m`, `5m`, `1h`, `1d`, `1w`, `1M`.
* Response codes: `200`, `201`, `202` (async), `204`, `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `422`, `429`, `500`.
* Idempotency: ingestion / job-creating endpoints accept `Idempotency-Key`.
* Aggregation semantics: server supports `aggregation` param: `sum|avg|min|max|count|p50|p90|p99`.
* Typical dimensions: `channel`, `country`, `currency`, `sku`, `category`, `warehouse`, `payment_method`, `customer_segment`, `campaign`.

# 18 — Design notes & best practices (short)

* **Single source vs derived store:** Keep analytics as a read-optimized derived store. Ingest from canonical event streams (order, payment, fulfillment). Maintain watermarks & idempotency to avoid double-counting.
* **Tiered storage & rollups:** Keep raw events (hot short-term) + detailed hourly/daily rollups + long-term aggregates. Use rollups to serve low-latency dashboards. Keep retention/archival policies configurable.
* **Cardinality awareness:** Monitor and cap cardinality explosion (sku × campaign × customer\_segment). Provide warnings and cardinality controls (pre-aggregate or sampling).
* **Freshness SLAs:** Expose freshness/latency metadata per query; allow `max_staleness` and `force_fresh` options for critical flows.
* **Deterministic aggregates:** Use event deduplication (event\_id) and monotonic watermarks. Recompute / backfill endpoints must be available for corrections.
* **Security & PII:** Mask PII in analytics where not needed; provide secure export controls and audit logs for data access. Support GDPR erasure by excluding or pseudonymizing datasets while preserving aggregates where possible.
* **Explainability:** For ML/forecast/what-if produce clear assumptions and CI/confidence intervals. Provide provenance (which events and models produced the numbers).
* **Observability & SLOs:** instrument ingestion lag, query latency, model training times and alert when backfills are required or connector lag grows.
* **Integration-first:** provide connectors to BI tools (Looker/Metabase/Tableau), data lakes (S3/BigQuery), streaming sinks (Kafka), and alerts (PagerDuty/Slack).
* **Test & dry-run:** allow `dry_run=true` for heavy queries/exports so analysts can validate without costing runs.
* **Access controls:** separate reader vs analyst vs admin roles; restrict exports and model training ops to privileged roles.

---

If you’d like I can next (pick one):

* generate an **OpenAPI (Swagger) skeleton** for the core endpoints (`/ingest`, `/kpis/query`, `/funnels/query`, `/cohorts/retention`, `/exports`),
* design the **time-series & aggregation schema** (suggested DDL for ClickHouse/TimescaleDB and rollup tables),
* or produce a **sample analytics client** (Node or Python) that shows safe ingestion, example KPI query and exporting results to S3.

Which one should I produce now?
