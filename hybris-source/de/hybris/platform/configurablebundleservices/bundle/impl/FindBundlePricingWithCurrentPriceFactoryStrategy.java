     * For non Bundle products it should worBundleNavigationNodeContentMainComponentk as is, so the DiscountValues should result
     * from the DiscountRows defined at the product.
     *
     * For Bundle products it should work in a different way: All other products where the
     * AbstractOrderEntries have the same entry group number should be added to a list for comparison. The Product of the current
     * AbstractOrderEntry will be used to identify PriceRules from the current BundleTemplate where that product is set
     * as a target. All conditional products of the rules have to be in the comparison list and that is how we find the
     * matching rules. If there are still multiple matching rules, because, then the one with the lowest price in the
     * current currency will be used as discount. That absolute discount will be converted into a relative DiscountValue
     * for the AbstractOrderEntry only. All calculations of totals later will work as is. For subscription products the
     * discount is applied to the 1st tier of recurring charge entries in the price plan. In case there is a price rule
     * that can be applied to the subscription product and there is also a discount that comes from the tiered recurring
     * charge entries, the better (= cheaper) price is used as discount.
     *
     * For subscription product, if the there is price rule with the billing event, the specific one time charge price
     * reduce logic will be applied.
